This assignment focuses on writing object-oriented code and applying modern coding conventions learnt during the course to create a Robot program; specifically, to utilise classes, interfaces, loops, conditionals and methods to reproduce the behaviour shown in the animated image above.

**Note:** This project was adapted from a template which was provided to students by the school faculty as to make it easier for them to mark assignment submissions.
